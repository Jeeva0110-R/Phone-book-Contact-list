Overview

The provided code is a Python script that implements a simple phonebook program. The program allows users to create, display, check, and delete contacts from a database. The database connection is established using the pymysql library.

Functions

The code consists of six functions:

connect_db(): Establishes a connection to the MySQL database.
welcome(): Displays a menu to the user and returns their input.
display_contacts(connection): Retrieves and displays all contacts from the database.
create_contact(connection): Creates a new contact in the database.
check_entry(connection): Retrieves and displays a specific contact from the database.
delete_contact(connection): Deletes a contact from the database.
phonebook(): The main function that orchestrates the program's flow.
Database Connection

The connect_db() function establishes a connection to a MySQL database using the pymysql library. The connection parameters are hardcoded, including the host, username, password, and database name.

Menu and User Input

The welcome() function displays a menu to the user, prompting them to enter a number corresponding to one of the following options:

Display existing contacts
Create a new contact
Check an entry
Delete an entry
Exit
The user's input is validated to ensure it is a number between 1 and 5.

Contact Management

The display_contacts(), create_contact(), check_entry(), and delete_contact() functions perform the following operations:

display_contacts(): Retrieves all contacts from the database and displays them to the user.
create_contact(): Creates a new contact in the database, checking for duplicate phone numbers.
check_entry(): Retrieves a specific contact from the database based on the user's input.
delete_contact(): Deletes a contact from the database, prompting the user for confirmation.
Program Flow

The phonebook() function is the main entry point of the program. It establishes a database connection and enters an infinite loop, displaying the menu to the user and processing their input accordingly. The program exits when the user chooses to exit (option 5).

Security and Best Practices

The code uses parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. However, the database connection parameters are hardcoded, which is not recommended for production environments. It is suggested to use environment variables or a secure configuration file to store sensitive information.

Code Quality and Readability

The code is well-organized, and the functions are clearly named and documented. The use of whitespace and indentation is consistent, making the code easy to read. However, some functions could be refactored to reduce repetition and improve code reuse.

Conclusion

The phonebook program is a simple yet functional implementation of a contact management system. While it lacks some security best practices, the code is well-organized and easy to follow. With some refinements, this program could be a useful tool for managing contacts.
